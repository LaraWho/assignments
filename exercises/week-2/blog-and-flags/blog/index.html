      <h2>Blogging on the star ship Enterprise</h2>
      <h4>January 21st 2019</h4>
      <p>
        Obviously the Time Lords have programmed the TARDIS always to return to Earth. It seems that I am some kind of a galactic yo-yo! Oh, my giddy aunt! Eh? Doctor who? What's he talking about…? Look at me. No plans, no backup, no weapons worth a damn. Oh, and something else I don't have: anything to lose. So, if you're sitting up there with your silly little spaceships and your silly little guns and you've any plans on taking the Pandorica tonight; just remember who's standing in your way. Remember every black day I ever stopped you and then, and then, do the smart thing. Let somebody else try first.

        Doctor no more. Your ideas are too narrow and crippled. I am a citizen of the universe and a gentleman to boot. Your wish is my command. But be careful what you wish for. That's a relief. I hate babysitters. An unintelligent enemy is far less dangerous than an intelligent one…. Death is always more frightening when it strikes invisibly. This is a situation that requires tact and finesse. Fortunately, I am blessed with both. Lots of planets have a North. Have faith, Brigadier. Have I ever led you astray?

        It is! It's the city of New New York! Strictly speaking, it's the fifteenth New York since the original, so that makes it New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New New York. Why can't you leave me alone?! Oh my word! People assume that time is a strict progression of cause-and-effect... but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly... timey-wimey... stuff. You've had this place redecorated, haven't you? Hmm, don't like it.
      </p>

        Oh I'm so sorry, Jamie. That's a relief. I hate babysitters. I've made many mistakes... and it's about time that I did something about that. My writing gets worse and worse. Dear, dear, dear, dear, dear. Aw, I wanted to be ginger! I've never been ginger! And you, Rose Tyler! Fat lot of good you were! You gave up on me! Ooh, that's rude. Is that the sort of man I am now? Am I rude? Rude and not ginger. If I grow to be half the man that you are, Clara Oswald, then I shall be happy indeed. Are you capable of speaking without flapping your hands about?
      </p>  
      <p>
        My ship…my TARDIS… Your ideas are too narrow and crippled. I am a citizen of the universe and a gentleman to boot. Blimey, trying to make an Ood laugh... It is! It's the city of New New York! Strictly speaking, it's the fifteenth New York since the original, so that makes it New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New New York. Shut up, K-9! It seems you have a very large rat Brigadier—maybe you should employ the services of a very large cat? No, not the hugging. I'm against the hugging.
