      Do you want a jelly baby? Don't be sad Grace. You'll do great things. Jamie, remind me to give you a lesson in tying knots, sometime. This thing is smaller on the inside than it is on the outside. Life depends on change and renewal. My ship…my TARDIS… Oh my word!

      It's rather a pity, in a way...now the universe is down to 699 wonders. A knight of the GRAND ORDER OF OBERON! Only I would be stupid enough to attack such a person! Why are you pointing your screwdrivers like that? They're scientific instruments, not water pistols. We are not of this race.

    <h3>JOBS</h3>

      What do you think it is, a space helmet for a cow? I've lived for over 2000 years and not all of them have been good. Goodbye, Clara. A straight line may be the shortest distance between two points, but it is by no means the most interesting. Your hips are fine, you're built like a man!

      Rose... before I go, I just want to tell you: you were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And do you know what? So was I! Thank you, Strax. And if I'm ever in need of advice from a psychotic potato dwarf, you'll certainly be the first to know.

      Dreams are important…never underestimate them. I am the Doctor! The original, you might say! Oh I'm so sorry, Jamie. Would you like a jelly baby? Goodbye... Fancypants! I don't like it. Courage isn’t a matter of not being frightened, it’s being afraid and doing what you have to do anyway.

    <h3>PETS</h3>
    <p>
      We are not of this earth. Susan and I are wanderers in the fourth dimension of time and space. Oh I'm so sorry, Jamie. There's something else I've always wanted to say: Allons-y, Alonso! Have a jelly baby. Now would you stand aside before I shoot myself?
